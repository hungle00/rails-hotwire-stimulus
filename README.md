# Rails-Stimulus-Hotwire

> Fun with some new [Rails related](https://hotwire.dev/) techs: tailwindcss-rails, hotwire-rails, stimulus-rails

Project is just for fun, don't pay attention for bussiness logic. Some notes:

* Create/delete comment in realtime with Hotwire

* With Stimulus
*Hovercard, infinite scroll with Stimulus*
*Type-ahead search*
*Update todos from checkbox, filter todo*
